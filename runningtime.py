Running times calculator

Processes a series of track sections by their length (meters) and the track speed
limit (entered in km/h, converted to m/s for internal calculations). The ultimate
goal is to calculate how many minutes it will take to proceed from one station to
the next, assuming that the train begins and ends stationary (that's how you're
supposed to be at a station, right?). It presumes upon a driver who knows the
track intimately, and may therefore estimate too low for reality (a more cautious
driver will apply the brakes sooner than the simulator would); in theory, this
could be solved by placing "Brake" posts at the appropriate points, but that is
outside the scope of this project.

Rules:

1) Speed limits may not be masked by other speed limits. If maximum deceleration
   from the beginning of this section will not get the train to the speed of the
   next section, we will throw an error (derailment). This can be resolved, in a
   way, by lowering the track speed limit of the previous section; imperfect but
   may get around the problem. But this should be an abnormal track construct.
2) Track sections must be longer than the train. It is not possible to span
   three sections. This could be fixed, but would require a more complex formula
   for calculating maxspeed.

Corollaries:
* The maximum safe speed for the train is the speed limit for the current
  section, or the speed limit for the previous section if position is less than
  train length (and the previous section was slower).
* The maximum attainable speed can be deduced entirely from the above and from
  the one next track section.
